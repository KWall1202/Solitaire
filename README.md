An in-progress implementation of Solitaire in Java.

I'm making this project to keep myself sharp, practice writing good documentation in my code, and to get a full project on github that I didn't make for a grade in a class.

If you want to steal any amount of this code, you're free to do so as long as you give credit to Kevin Wallace either in your code or somewhere related to your code (On a credits page of a website for your project, for example).
